Description
===========

A Chef cookbook for installing and configuring boto.

# Cookbook Dependencies

* python
* build-essential

Usage
=====

Example node.json to install & configure boto, plus fetch a file from S3:

	{
	  "boto": {
	    "install_method":"pip",
	    "aws_access_key_id":"foo",
	    "aws_secret_access_key":"bar",
	    "s3_fetch_bucket":"foo_bucket",
	    "s3_fetch_file":"foo_file.txt",
	    "s3_fetch_file_destination":"/tmp/foo_file.txt",
	  },
	  "run_list": [ "recipe[boto::default]", "recipe[boto::s3_fetch_file]" ]
	}

Same, but fetch and extract a zip file from S3 instead:

	{
	  "boto": {
	    "install_method":"pip",
	    "aws_access_key_id":"foo",
	    "aws_secret_access_key":"bar",
	    "s3_fetch_bucket":"foo_bucket",
	    "s3_fetch_file":"foo_file.zip",
	    "s3_fetch_file_destination":"/tmp/foo_file.zip",
	    "s3_file_extract_destination":"/root"
	  },
	  "run_list": [ "recipe[boto::default]", "recipe[boto::s3_fetch_and_extract_file]" ]
	}
